SimpleExceptionDefinition
=========================

I've found in a few projects I define quite a few custom exceptions, I prefer them as they often express the intent of the exception much more clearly and can increase readability.  However, most follow a very similar pattern, which isn't very DRY at all, so this plugin goes a little way to help with that.  


Example
=======

class Example

	define_exception :my_custom_exception
	
	def rescue_bad_things
		begin
			do_bad_things
		rescue MyCustomException => e
			logger.error(e.message)
		end
	end
	
	def do_bad_things
		raise MyCustomException.new("Error message")
	end

end

instead of:

class Example
	...
end

class MyCustomException < StandardError
	def initialize( error_message, object )
		@message = error_message
		@object = object
	end
	
	def message
		@message
	end
end

Saves a few lines at least :)
